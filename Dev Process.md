Hello, introduction text here

## Brief

KTT that stands for Kill team tracker is a software that is used supposed to be a note taking companion app for the tabletop wargame "Kill team". This brief will refer to terminology of the game, if you do not know what Kill team is read there is the "What is kill team" paragraph below, this goes over relevant rules and the process of playing a game.

Kill team has a lot of rules, situational abilities and and other things to keep track of which can be overwhelming for players, new and old. As the game goes on new rules can be added and are spread over multiple websites, books and online PDF files as new rules are overwrite what is written in books. Additionally it can be hard to keep track of what is happening on the table as the game progresses. The purpose of KTT is to compile relevent rules when you need them on top of tracking what is happening on the table, along with additional features such as tracking soldiers statistics between games.

KTT shall have the option for the user to create and update rules for a existing kill teams along with creating a kill team roster. When creating a kill team roster they can fill it with soldiers the team can field along with giving the soldiers names, and descriptions to make sure you always use the same model for that soldier. Each soldier should also have customisable trackers to track the soldiers feats such as points scored, kills, deaths and anything else I wish to track. There limit to how many soldiers can be in a list should not be noticable.

There should also be functionality to take a team into a game, where the user can select any number of soldiers from their own roster to be taken into the game along with equipment their team has, the equipment should be able to be given to certain soldiers whilst also showing the total cost how much equipment is being used. There shouldn't be hard limits given to how much equipment can be given only warnings. After this the user should be able to manage their secondary objectives through the app.

Once the game starts, it should start in the strategy phase of round 1 with a relevant amount of CP, it should display the teams rules that occur in the strategy phase along with the ability to spend CP for strategic ploys and opportunity to reveal secondary objectives, then the round can begin where the selected options should be easily accessible. Now in the firefight phase the player shall be able to mark their soldiers as activated, along with changing their statistics whilst playing. When viewing a soldier there should descriptions of all abilities and rules they have, along with the rules for their weapons. If a weapons rule or other abilities rule references another rule tapping on it shall show the relevant rule without leaving the soldiers page. Additionally trackers for a soldier shall be able to be viewed and edited mid game

#### What is "Kill team?"

Kill team is a competitive tabletop wargame where 2 players create an elite team of soldiers from a specific set of teams with their own roster of soldiers, scoring points by capturing objectives, scoring personalised ones and competing over resources. The two players after finding a game will set up an area to play and determine what the mission is. The mission determines what equipment, objectives, locations players start on the board, and other various rules. After this is done they choose select a kill team from a list of many teams which have unique rules, abilities and actions. Each kill team has a roster of soldiers to choose from. All soldiers have different statistics, weapons, abilities and unique actions. Some soldiers must be unique, one soldier must be a leader. Each team also has access to unique abilities, unique equipment and 3 of their own secondary objectives, and a keyword that determines their secondary objectives.

Once a team has been made the player chooses their teams equipment which depends on what team they are playing and what the objectives are, every equipment has a cost some can only be equipped by the team once, equipment can change how certain rules work, or grant actions, some equipment can only be used once per game. Both teams have "10 points" of equipment. Once equipment has been chosen the players draw from a deck of cards for their "secondary objectives" each team can only use certain cards and gets 3 unique cards. Then after choosing 6 they shuffle, draw 2 and remove 1 until they only have 3 cards left these remain for the remainder of the game.

After this, the players determine who goes first and other rules before generating a resource called "CP", this CP is used to purchase temporary benefits to gain the upper hand during the game...

Note to me write CP uses, point tracking and health and killing people + winning + turning points. Then write the option of matched player + Narrative play
