# ktt dev process
I am Alfred, and this repository is for the documenting the process of creating an app for myself so I can share it possibly in a portfolio, with other students, professors or anyone else who shows interest.

This repository will not be the same one which I actually use for the software, the reasoning behind this is incase this ever becomes open source or public in some way I don't want users to filter through documentation of the development. This repository is for the development documentation whereas the software and documentation for that will be in another repository which is linked here(ADD LINK HERE ONCE I GET IT)
